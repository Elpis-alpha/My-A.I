# My-A.I

It's not actually an A.I, it's just a simple javascript 
application that registers a user, collects data from the
user and manipulates it into information.

It doesn't have an actual database, everything is saved
in the local storage of the browser.

With that said, it doesn't support cross device functionality
for obvious reasons. Also it is still a prototype, the 
complete version will be released in due time

This is pure vanilla javascript, no frameworks or library was 
used for development.

the application or check out my portfolio
